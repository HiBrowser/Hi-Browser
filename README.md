A quick proof-of-concept code browser for the DC Code.

This is a much simpler and less feature-rich system that more developed
stuff like [The State Decoded](http://www.statedecoded.com/), but ideally
is either a proof-of-concept of a fully static approach or at least a useful
tool for proofing [our parser](https://github.com/openlawdc/dc-decoded).
